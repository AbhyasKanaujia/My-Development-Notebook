# Express



Express.js is a **back-end web application framework** for building **RESTful APIs** with **Node.js**.

* Express can be **used to serve static files** using `app.use(express.static("public"));`
* The most important concept in react is **Routing.**
* Express uses **Middleware** to **provide** more **functionalities**.&#x20;

## Routing

Express **takes a client request**, **matches** it against any **routes** that are present, and **executes the handler function** that is associated with that route. This is Routing.&#x20;

A route specification consists of:&#x20;

1. An **HTTP method** (GET, POST, etc.)
2. A **path specification** that matches the request URI
3. The **route handler**

### Request matching

The requests are matched in the order in which they are specified. So the more specific routes must appear before more general routes.&#x20;

`/*` Appears at the very end.&#x20;

### Handler Function

The handler function is expected to generate the appropriate response.

* The handler is passed in a **request object** and a **response object**.
* The request **object** can be **inspected** to get the various **details of the request**.
* The response objectâ€™s **methods** can be **used to send** the **response** to the client.

#### Middleware vs Route

A middleware function deals with _any_ request matching the path specification, regardless of the HTTP method.

A route can match a request with a specific HTTP method. So, instead of `app.use()`, `app.get()` has to be used in order to match the GET HTTP method.

### Parameters to a handler function

A handler function is provided with two parameters, the request object and the response object.&#x20;

#### Request Object



### Route Parameters

**Route parameters** are **named URL segments** that are used to **capture** the **values** specified **at their position in** the **URL**.

It has the following form:&#x20;

```javascript
app.get('/products/:productId', getSingleProductById);
```

This will match `app.com/products/123`

## Creating a basic express server

### Backend files and folders

First, create a folder for the project `mkdir myapp.` This is the root of the project. This is where we install all the backend dependencies inside a folder called `node_modules`.

```bash
mkdir myapp
```

Create a folder called `backend` inside `myapp`. This is where all the routes, models and controllers for the API live.

```bash
cd myapp
mkdir backend
```

Create a file called `server.js` in `backend.` This is the entry point to the server.

Initialize the project at the root of the project by using `npm init`. Set `server.js` as the entry point. This will create a `package.json` in the root.&#x20;

```bash
cd .. # to reach the root of the project
npm init
```

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project with the following content

{% code title=".gitignore" %}
```
node_modules
.env
```
{% endcode %}

This will save us from uploading the node\_modules and settings file to GitHub.

Install the dependencies into the root of the project.

### Install dependencies and add scripts

```bash
npm i express dotenv mongoose colors
```

To save us from constantly restarting the server we can install a dependency called `nodemon` as a&#x20;

development dependency.

```bash
npm i -D nodemon
```

Add scripts to start and to run the server in `package.json`

```json
...
"scripts" : {
    "start": "node backend/server.js",
    "server": "nodemon backend/server.js"
},
...
```

### Git

In the root of the folder initialize a git repository and make an initial commit.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

### Basic server setup

Create a file called `.env` in the `root` of the project with the following content

```toml
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
```

Any change you make to the `.env` file requires a restart of the server.

In `server.js` create a basic server and listen for requests.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
const express = require('express');

cons dotenv = required('dotenv').config();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

const app = express();

app.listen(PORT, console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT} in ${process.env.NODE_ENV} mode`));
```
{% endcode %}
